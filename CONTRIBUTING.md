# Contributing to EDB

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EDB! We welcome contributions from the community and are grateful for any help you can provide.

## Legal Requirements

### Contributor License Agreement

**Important:** Before we can accept your contributions, you must sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CLA.md).

When you submit your first pull request, the CLA Assistant bot will automatically check if you have signed the CLA. If you haven't, it will provide instructions on how to sign it electronically. Your pull request cannot be merged until the CLA is signed.

**Why do we require a CLA?**
- It ensures you have the right to contribute the code
- It allows us to relicense the project if needed (e.g., for dual-licensing)
- It protects both you and the project maintainers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.89.0 or higher
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/edb.git
   cd EDB
   ```

3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/edb-rs/edb.git
   ```

4. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build all crates
cargo build

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# Check specific crate
cargo check -p edb-engine
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for a specific crate
cargo test -p edb-common
```

*Note: Tests are still being finalized, so `cargo test` may currently fail.*

### Code Quality

Before submitting a PR, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt --all

# Run clippy
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Rust's official style guidelines
- Use `cargo fmt` to format your code
