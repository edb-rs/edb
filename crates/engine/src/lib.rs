//! EDB Engine - Advanced Ethereum smart contract debugging and analysis engine.
//!
//! This crate provides the core debugging engine for EDB (Ethereum Debugger), enabling
//! detailed analysis and debugging of smart contract execution at both opcode and source levels.
//! The engine supports real-time expression evaluation, comprehensive snapshot management,
//! and advanced debugging features for Ethereum smart contracts.
//!
//! # Key Features
//!
//! ## üîç **Multi-Level Debugging**
//! - **Opcode-level debugging**: Step through EVM bytecode execution
//! - **Source-level debugging**: Debug using original Solidity source code
//! - **Hybrid debugging**: Switch seamlessly between opcode and source views
//!
//! ## üì∏ **Snapshot System**
//! - Capture execution state at any point during contract execution
//! - Navigate forward/backward through execution history
//! - Support for both hook-based and opcode-based snapshots
//!
//! ## ‚ö° **Real-time Expression Evaluation**
//! - Evaluate Solidity-like expressions against any execution snapshot
//! - Access variables, function calls, storage, and blockchain context
//! - Support for complex expressions with type casting and operations
//!
//! ## üîó **JSON-RPC API**
//! - Complete debugging API for frontend integration
//! - WebSocket and HTTP support for real-time debugging
//! - Comprehensive error handling and protocol compliance
//!
//! ## üõ† **Advanced Analysis**
//! - Contract instrumentation for debugging hooks
//! - Source code analysis and mapping
//! - ABI resolution and type inference
//! - Storage layout analysis
//!
//! # Core Modules
//!
//! - [`analysis`] - Source code analysis and contract instrumentation
//! - [`core`] - Core engine types and execution management
//! - [`context`] - Engine context and state management
//! - [`eval`] - Expression evaluation system
//! - [`inspector`] - EVM execution inspectors for data collection
//! - [`instrumentation`] - Contract instrumentation and code generation
//! - [`rpc`] - JSON-RPC debugging API
//! - [`snapshot`] - Snapshot management and analysis
//! - [`tweak`] - Runtime contract modification for debugging
//! - [`utils`] - Utility functions and helpers
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use edb_engine::{EngineContext, DebugRpcServer};
//! use revm::primitives::Address;
//!
//! // Create engine context with debugging data
//! let context = EngineContext::new(db, snapshots, trace, artifacts);
//!
//! // Start RPC server for debugging API
//! let server = DebugRpcServer::new(context);
//! let handle = server.start().await?;
//!
//! println!("Debug server running on port {}", handle.port());
//! ```
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The EDB engine follows a modular architecture:
//!
//! 1. **Data Collection**: Inspectors collect execution data during EVM execution
//! 2. **Snapshot Management**: Captured data is organized into navigable snapshots
//! 3. **Expression Evaluation**: Real-time evaluation against snapshot data
//! 4. **API Layer**: JSON-RPC interface exposes all debugging functionality
//! 5. **Analysis**: Deep contract analysis for enhanced debugging experience
