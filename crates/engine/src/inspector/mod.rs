//! EVM execution inspectors for debugging and analysis.
//!
//! This module provides various inspector implementations that hook into the EVM
//! execution process to collect debugging information, create snapshots, and
//! modify execution behavior for debugging purposes.
//!
//! # Inspector Types
//!
//! ## [`CallTracer`]
//! Traces all contract calls during execution, building a hierarchical call tree
//! that captures the complete execution flow including internal calls, delegate calls,
//! and create operations.
//!
//! ## [`HookSnapshotInspector`]
//! Creates detailed snapshots at specific hook points during execution, capturing
//! local variables, state variables, and execution context for source-level debugging.
//! This inspector works with source maps and debug information to provide high-level
//! debugging capabilities.
//!
//! ## [`OpcodeSnapshotInspector`]
//! Creates snapshots at the opcode level, capturing low-level EVM state including
//! stack, memory, storage, and transient storage. Useful for detailed execution
//! analysis and opcode-level debugging.
//!
//! ## [`TweakInspector`]
//! Allows runtime modification of contract bytecode and behavior for debugging
//! purposes. Can inject custom logic, modify return values, and alter execution
//! flow to test different scenarios.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Inspectors are typically chained together to provide comprehensive debugging:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let call_tracer = CallTracer::new();
//! let hook_inspector = HookSnapshotInspector::new(context);
//! let opcode_inspector = OpcodeSnapshotInspector::new(context);
//! ```
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! All inspectors implement the REVM `Inspector` trait. Each inspector focuses
//! on a specific aspect of execution analysis while maintaining minimal overhead
//! when not actively collecting data.
